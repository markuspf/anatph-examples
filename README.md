# ANATPH Examples

This repository contains a collection of examples generated
to test pregroup algorithms.

There are multiple types of examples, and multiple formats.

 * Randomly created presentations over pregroups
   I stored them to reproduce tests and compare results
   and speed between different implementations and
   while my code is evolving.
   The code for creating the series of examples currently
   lives in the ANATPH repository on GitHub, but should 
   be moved into this one.

 * Triangle groups and quotients of triangle groups
   While these can be generated by code they are here
   for the purposes of uniform testing.
 
 * Other groups, examples of pregroup presentations of groups
   to test algorithms (currently the hyperbolicity tester)
